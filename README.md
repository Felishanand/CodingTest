# CodingTest
# It is a project to implement test project.

#It implement a Promotion Engine for a shopping kart.

#Promotion Engine works based on 2 idesa.
#  1. N quantity for A product for fixed price.
#  2. A combination of different products for Fixed price.
 
# I have created few Interfaces to implement by concrete classes, so that future extentions are smooth.
# Model folder contains calsses for Item, KartItem and Shopping Kart.
#Promotion is difefrent from Shopping Kart
#.Promotion Engine is the class thkes the shopping Karft and Promotions as arguments and Apply Promotions defined in Promotion class.

#Currently No impleemntation for Customer info, whihc can be adeed as Aggregation.
#Promotions can be designed Dynamically. ( Whihc can be further saved in DB and fetch as Future extension. )
